  <h3><strong>Getting Started</strong></h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        <strong>To Begin a Consultation, We Request the Following Information:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><u><strong>The last three year-end financial statements from the external accountant (CPA)</strong></u></li>
            <p>
                These should be either “Review Engagement” or “Audited” quality for larger, more complex loan
                requests. In the case of small loans, a Compilation Report may be sufficient for some lenders.
                The entire report is required including notes to financial statements.
            </p>
        <li><u><strong>Interim financial statements to whichever month-end is completed</strong></u></li>
            <p>
                These are generated by the company’s internal accounting staff. These should consist of an income statement which
                covers the year-to-date period as well as a balance sheet.
            </p>
        <li><u><strong>Aged Accounts Payable and Aged Accounts Receivable</strong></u></li>
            <p>
                These should be at the same date as the balance sheet in section (2) above.
            </p>
        <li><u><strong>Interim financial statements from the prior year</strong></u></li>
            <p>
                Similar to (2) above, but from one year earlier.
            </p>
        <li><u><strong>Proforma Income Statement</strong></u></li>
            <p>
                For the next two fiscal year ends. This should be two 12 month
                forecasts and provide a rationale for the numbers presented.
            </p>
        <li><u><strong>Cash Flow Forecast</strong></u></li>
            <p>
                This should be for the next 24 months and completed on a monthly basis.
                The cash flow forecast should take into consideration capital expenditures and estimated
                financing.
            </p>
        <li><u><strong>A <strong>short</strong> written description</strong></u></li>
            <p>
                This description should cover what the money will be used for and how this financing positively
                impacts the company in both qualitative and quantitative terms. <strong>This should be one page or
                less.</strong>
            </p>
    </ol>
