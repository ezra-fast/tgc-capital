  <h3><strong><u>Change of Ownership Financing</u></strong></h3>
</div>

It can be difficult and complicated to source the financing needed to complete a change of ownership.
You may find it frustrating that a company with years of strong earnings, a solid balance sheet, and
management with a good track record of success, is having difficulty finding a lender they can work with
to both understand the situation and participate in financing.

TGC Capital can meet with you, listen and understand your financing needs, and work with you to build
a detailed lending case that can then be used to approach lenders.

  <h3><strong><u>Financing Growth</u></strong></h3>
</div>

Your company is growing and needs access to financing. Your experience with lenders has been
frustrating in that they don’t seem to understand your financing needs or business potential. You have
not been able to access the financing you need.

TGC Capital can meet with you, listen and understand your financing needs, and work with you to build
a detailed lending case that can then be used to approach lenders.

  <h3><strong><u>Review of your Current Financing Structure</u></strong></h3>
</div>

Your financing structure (interest rate, security, terms &amp; conditions, fee structure, amortization period,
etc.) has been in place for a number of years. However, your company has continued to become
stronger. It’s more profitable and its balance sheet is more robust then ever. Yet, your financing
structure hasn’t changed much. Might it be a good idea to review your financing package with your
lender? Might it be a good choice to have experienced lenders on your side of the negotiating table?

TGC Capital can meet with you, carefully review and understand your increasing financial strength, and
work with you to build a detailed case that can then be used to approach lenders. The goal is to work
towards negotiating a better financing package for you.
