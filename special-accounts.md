    <p>
        TGC Capital Inc. (TGC) works directly with senior and secondary lenders to help the borrower return to a
        performing account status. TGC recognizes that Special Accounts Officers have a mandate to work with
        clients as long as possible, to rectify situations which could impact the borrowerâ€™s ability to continue as a
        Going Concern and to ensure quick payout of clients which are no longer a fit for the Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clients assigned to a Special Accounts status have often experienced an industry wide down turn which
        has resulted in substantially lower revenue and profitability. As the industry recovers, rebounding sales
        put additional stress on the company which does not have the historic earnings or margining capability to
        finance the working capital needed to increase sales.
